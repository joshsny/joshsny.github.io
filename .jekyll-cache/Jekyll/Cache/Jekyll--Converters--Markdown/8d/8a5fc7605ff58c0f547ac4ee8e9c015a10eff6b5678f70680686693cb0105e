I"P<p>I helped TimeNavi to build there online presence by creating a website for them where they could get users to sign up for their time management courses. Since launching the new website, they were able to attract new customers and increase customer retention. They were previously having an issue that customers would show interest in the product, but would not undergo the necessary steps to sign up and share theyâ€™re calendar. By providing a simple to use website which automatically leads the user to instructions when they sign up, customer retention has increased significantly.</p>
